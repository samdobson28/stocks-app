## Getting Started
This simple react web app takes in data from data.txt with a fetch('/data.txt') endpoint, then averages each stock's avg price with a processData function, and displays it on a React frontend. It also console logs the array produced by the function. The console log can be seen by inspecting the webpage after starting it. See [Installation](#installation) to start.

## Technology Stack
